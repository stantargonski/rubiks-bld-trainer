/**
 * When you actually practised, a square per day.
 *
 * Every other chart on this page answers "how fast"; this one answers "how
 * often", which is the question the others quietly depend on. A month-long gap
 * explains a flat average better than any statistic about the solves themselves.
 *
 * Laid out a month to a block, each block exactly as many columns wide as that
 * month needs, with the 1st sitting on its real weekday. The blocks butt up
 * against each other on the same rhythm as the weeks inside them, so the seven
 * weekday rows run unbroken across the whole strip and a month boundary shows
 * as the notch where one month's last week meets the next month's first.
 *
 * Except when there is no notch to show. A month that ends on a Sunday hands
 * the next one a whole clean column to start on, so the two ran together as one
 * unbroken grid with nothing between them — the boundary the layout relies on
 * simply wasn't there. Those blocks get the space a notch would have taken.
