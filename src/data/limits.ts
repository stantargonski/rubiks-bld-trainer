/**
 * The bounds every imported file is held to, and the reasoning behind them.
 *
 * A file arrives because someone chose it, and "chosen" is not "trusted":
 * exports get mailed around, posted in Discord and downloaded from strangers,
 * and a file that is merely corrupt arrives through the same input as one built
 * to cause trouble. So nothing read from a file is believed — it is bounded.
 *
 * There is no HTML sink anywhere in this app (React escapes every string it
 * draws and nothing calls innerHTML or eval), so the interesting attacks are
 * not script injection. They are:
 *
 *   exhaustion — a hundred megabytes of JSON, or a session holding ten million
 *     solves, freezing the tab for as long as it takes to parse and render;
 *   eviction — an import large enough to blow the ~5 MB localStorage allowance,
 *     which does not fail loudly but leaves the store unwritable, so the next
 *     reload silently loses the solves you already had;
 *   spoofing — a session "name" carrying bidi overrides or ten thousand
 *     characters, which React will faithfully draw straight through the picker
 *     and out the other side of the layout.
 *
 * Each limit below answers one of those. They are deliberately generous — a
 * real csTimer history has to pass — but they are finite, which is the point.
